## PCIRCLE ARBITRAGE STRATEGY - PLAN & STATUS

### CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS
❌ **MAJOR ISSUE**: Most provided addresses fail standard interface calls
❌ **WETH, CIRCLE, pCircle, pfUSDC**: All have contract code but interface calls fail  
✅ **USDC Alternative Found**: USDbC at 0xd9aaec86b65d86f6a7b5b1b0c42ffa531710b6ca works
✅ **BaseSwap WETH/USDC**: Confirmed working at 0xab067c01C7F5734da168C699Ae9d23a4512c9FdB

### IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

#### STEP 1: Verify Network & Find Working Addresses (15 mins)
- [ ] Double-check we're on Base Mainnet (Chain ID: 8453)
- [ ] Find correct WETH address (0x4200... might be wrapped differently)  
- [ ] Verify CIRCLE token exists and is tradeable
- [ ] Get correct pCircle and pfUSDC addresses from official sources

#### STEP 2: Alternative Strategy - Use Working Components (30 mins)
Instead of fighting unknown interfaces, let's:
- [ ] Use USDbC (0xd9aaec86b65d86f6a7b5b1b0c42ffa531710b6ca) instead of USDC
- [ ] Find a different pod that contains well-known tokens (WETH, ETH, USDbC)
- [ ] Use existing arbitrage pattern with known working DEX pairs

#### STEP 3: Find Alternative Arbitrage Opportunities (45 mins)
Since pCircle addresses are problematic:
- [ ] Look for other Peapods pods containing liquid tokens (WETH, ETH, USDbC)
- [ ] Find pods with actual price discrepancies we can exploit
- [ ] Use existing BaseSwap pairs we know work

### RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES:

**Option A: Fix pCircle Strategy**
- Research Peapods documentation for correct addresses
- Find official deployment transactions
- Test with correct ABIs

**Option B: Switch to Different Pod** 
- Find pods containing WETH or ETH (more liquid)  
- Use proven BaseSwap pairs
- Focus on pods with verified price gaps

**Option C: Use Existing Working Infrastructure**
- Your current arbitrage bot works for WETH/USDC
- Just need to find the right pod with WETH
- Modify existing contract minimally

### NEXT STEPS:

1. **Immediate**: Find working pod with liquid tokens
2. **Quick win**: Use existing bot framework with different pod
3. **Long-term**: Fix pCircle addresses when we have official sources

Would you prefer to:
A) Keep debugging pCircle addresses
B) Switch to a different pod with working tokens  
C) Find official Peapods documentation first

**Time estimate for working bot**: 1-2 hours if we use existing infrastructure
